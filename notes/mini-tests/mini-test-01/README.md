# Preparation for Mini-Test-01

## 01

Create a command that creates a folder named exercises. Inside the `exercises` folder, create folders `week01`, `week02`, â€¦, `week12`, and `week13`. Then, inside `week01`, create a file named `Complete.txt` and save your username as the first line using the command `whoami`.
```
mkdir -p ~/exercises/week{01..13}; whoami > ~/exercises/week01/Complete.txt;
```
