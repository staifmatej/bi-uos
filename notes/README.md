# Notes

A shell is a program that provides a user interface to interact with the operating system – allowing you to run commands, execute programs, and write scripts.

The first shell ever created was the Thompson shell in 1971 at Bell Labs for Unix. The Bourne shell (sh) came later, in 1977, also at Bell Labs, and became the basis for most modern Unix shells, including Bash.

## Commands

### `ls`

**What it does:** lists the contents of a directory – files and folders.

```bash
ls
```

**Most common arguments:**<br>
-l → long format (details about files: permissions, owner, size, date)<br>
-a → all (shows hidden files, starting with a dot, e.g., .DS_Store)<br>
-h → human-readable (file sizes in KB, MB, GB; often combined with -l)<br>
-R → recursive (also shows contents of subdirectories)<br>
-t → sort by modification time (orders by last change)<br>
-r → reverse (reverses the sorting order)<br>
-S → sort by size (orders by file size)<br>
```bash
(base) ➜  bi-uos git:(main) ls
